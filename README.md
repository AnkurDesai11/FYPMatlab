Final Year Project matlab version control repo

This repository contains the Matlab Simulink schematics and the final project report files created as part of the final year project requirement for Btech Electrical Engineering at VJTI. 
This project simulates a DC bus load line to be used in a residential setting and explores the possibility of such systems replacing existing AC systems. 
The reson to choose DC over AC is to integrate rapidly available reneveable sources of energy like Solar which generate energy in DC and conversion for use and storage introduces losses.
